Symbol visualization view tasks:


-- center the line counters

-- sometimes the comments popup opens very thin

-- the user should be able to right click on a symbol box and have a context menu with the items:
  - Explain latest change
  - Revert change
  when the user clicks on "explain latest change", the details of the latest change to that symbol box should be copied to the clipboard
  ,including the symbol label, type and line numbers. it will create a prompt that says: "please explain the following change. do not change any code, just reply"
