Symbol visualization view tasks:

-- in cs files, variable changes inside functions are still drawn as "variable" boxes. they should be categorized and function changes


-- on code change, make the comment text green on translucent white, make the font a bit smaller and place the box under the file box so it doesn't obscure it
only display comment from the newly added or changed code not the entire file. also preserve newlines
