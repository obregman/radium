# radium-features.yaml Configuration Guide

## Overview

The `radium-features.yaml` file allows you to define and visualize your product features, their relationships to components, and dependencies between features. This provides a high-level view of your product roadmap and how features map to your technical architecture.

## Location

Place the `radium-features.yaml` file at the root of your workspace:

```
/your-project/
  radium-features.yaml
  radium-components.yaml
  src/
  package.json
  ...
```

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - featureKey:
      name: Display Name
      description: Feature description
      status: in-progress
      owner: Team or person name
      components:
        - component-key-1
        - component-key-2
      dependencies:
        - other-feature-key
```

## Structure

### Features Array

The root element must be `spec` containing a `features` array with feature definitions.

### Feature Properties

Each feature is defined as an object with a single key (the feature identifier). The value contains:

- **name** (required): Display name shown in the visualization
- **description** (optional): Detailed description of the feature
- **status** (optional): One of `planned`, `in-progress`, `completed`, or `deprecated`. Defaults to `in-progress`
- **owner** (optional): Team or person responsible for the feature
- **components** (optional): Array of component keys from `radium-components.yaml`
- **dependencies** (optional): Array of other feature keys this feature depends on
- **flow** (optional): Array of flow items describing the feature's user flow or process steps

## Flow Items

Flow items describe the sequential steps in a feature's user flow or process. Each flow item has:

- **type** (required): One of `user`, `window`, `system`, `api`, or `database`
- **name** (required): Short name for the step
- **description** (optional): Detailed description of what happens in this step

Flow types are visualized with different colors:
- **user**: Purple - User actions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
- **window**: Orange - UI/screen changes
- **system**: Green - System processes
- **api**: Red - API calls
- **database**: Gray - Database operations

## Visualization

### Opening the Features Map

Run the command: `Radium: Features Map`

### Visual Elements

The features map displays features in a **hierarchical tree layout**:

- **Root Features**: Parent features appear at the top (larger boxes)
- **Sub-features**: Child features appear below their parents
- **Flow Items**: Sequential steps in a feature's flow appear horizontally below the feature
- **Components**: Technical components appear at the bottom

- **Feature Nodes**: Blue rectangular boxes representing features
  - Root features are larger and more prominent
  - Sub-features are smaller and positioned below their parents

- **Flow Item Nodes**: Colored rounded rectangles representing flow steps
  - **Purple**: User actions
  - **Orange**: Window/screen changes
  - **Green**: System processes
  - **Red**: API calls
  - **Gray**: Database operations

- **Component Nodes**: Cyan rectangular boxes representing technical components

- **Edges**:
  - **Gray lines**: Parent-child relationships between features
  - **Blue curved lines**: Feature uses component
  - **Purple dashed lines**: Connection from feature to its flow
  - **Gray arrows**: Sequential flow between steps

### Interactions

- **Click a feature**: View details including status, owner, components, and dependencies
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel or pinch gesture
- **Pan**: Click and drag the background

## Use Cases

### Feature Flows

Document user flows and process steps for features:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - checkout:
      name: Checkout Process
      components:
        - frontend
        - backend
        - payment-service
      flow:
        - type: user
          name: Review cart
          description: User reviews items in shopping cart
        - type: user
          name: Click checkout
          description: User initiates checkout process
        - type: window
          name: Show shipping form
          description: Display shipping address form
        - type: user
          name: Enter shipping info
          description: User fills in shipping details
        - type: window
          name: Show payment form
          description: Display payment information form
        - type: user
          name: Enter payment details
          description: User enters credit card information
        - type: api
          name: Process payment
          description: Send payment to payment gateway
        - type: database
          name: Create order
          description: Save order to database
        - type: window
          name: Show confirmation
          description: Display order confirmation page
```

### Product Roadmap

Visualize your entire product roadmap with feature status:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - mvp-core:
      name: MVP Core Features
      status: completed
      components: [frontend, backend]
      
  - v2-enhancements:
      name: Version 2 Enhancements
      status: in-progress
      components: [frontend, backend]
      dependencies: [mvp-core]
      
  - v3-advanced:
      name: Version 3 Advanced Features
      status: planned
      components: [frontend, backend, ml-service]
      dependencies: [v2-enhancements]
```

### Feature-Component Mapping

Understand which components are involved in each feature:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - checkout-flow:
      name: Checkout Flow
      components:
        - frontend
        - backend
        - payment-service
        - notification-service
```

### Dependency Management

Track feature dependencies to plan development order:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - base-api:
      name: Base API
      status: completed
      dependencies: []
      
  - api-auth:
      name: API Authentication
      status: completed
      dependencies: [base-api]
      
  - api-rate-limiting:
      name: API Rate Limiting
      status: in-progress
      dependencies: [api-auth]
```

### Team Ownership

Assign features to teams and track progress:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - mobile-app:
      name: Mobile Application
      owner: Mobile Team
      status: in-progress
      
  - web-app:
      name: Web Application
      owner: Web Team
      status: completed
      
  - api-backend:
      name: API Backend
      owner: Backend Team
      status: completed
```

## Integration with Components

The `radium-features.yaml` works best when combined with `radium-components.yaml`:

**radium-components.yaml**:
```yaml
spec:
  components:
    - frontend:
        name: Frontend
        files:
          - src/ui/**
          - src/components/**
    
    - backend:
        name: Backend
        files:
          - src/api/**
          - src/services/**
```

**radium-features.yaml**:
```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - user-dashboard:
      name: User Dashboard
      components:
        - frontend  # References component from radium-components.yaml
        - backend
```

The Features Map will show both the high-level features and the technical components they depend on.

## Tips

### Start with High-Level Features

Begin with major features and refine over time:

```yaml
spec:
  features:
  - core-functionality:
      name: Core Functionality
      status: completed
      
  - advanced-features:
      name: Advanced Features
      status: in-progress
      
  - future-enhancements:
      name: Future Enhancements
      status: planned
```

### Use Status Effectively

Keep status up to date to track progress:

- `planned`: Not started, in the roadmap
- `in-progress`: Actively being developed
- `completed`: Done and deployed
- `deprecated`: No longer maintained or being removed

### Document Dependencies

Always document feature dependencies to avoid circular dependencies and plan development order.

### Assign Owners

Use the owner field to clarify responsibility and facilitate communication.

## Troubleshooting

### Features Map Shows Error

1. Check file is named exactly `radium-features.yaml` at workspace root
2. Verify YAML syntax is valid
3. Ensure `features` array exists
4. Check VS Code output for parsing errors

### Components Not Showing

If component nodes don't appear:

1. Verify component keys match those in `radium-components.yaml`
2. Check that components are referenced by at least one feature

### Dependencies Not Showing

If dependency edges don't appear:

1. Verify dependency keys match other feature keys exactly
2. Check for typos in feature keys
