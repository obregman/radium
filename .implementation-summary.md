# radium.yaml Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented support for `radium.yaml` configuration file that allows users to define custom logical components for the codebase map visualization, overriding the default directory-based grouping.

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created

1. **src/config/radium-config.ts**
   - `RadiumConfigLoader` class for parsing and managing YAML configuration
   - Supports component definitions with name, description, and file patterns
   - Implements glob pattern matching for file paths (`**`, `*`)
   - Provides `getComponentForFile()` to determine which component a file belongs to

2. **radium.yaml.example**
   - Example configuration showing Radium's own component structure
   - Demonstrates syntax with 7 components (Views, Data Store, Code Indexer, etc.)

3. **docs/radium-yaml.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation for radium.yaml configuration
   - Includes syntax guide, examples, best practices, and troubleshooting

### Modified Files

1. **src/views/map-panel.ts**
   - Added `configLoader` parameter to constructor and `createOrShow()`
   - Created `buildComponentBasedGraph()` method for component-based visualization
   - Modified `buildHierarchicalGraph()` to check for config and use components if available
   - Updated D3.js visualization to handle 'component' node type:
     - Added component color (#00BCD4 cyan) to colorMap
     - Added component size (22) to sizeMap
     - Updated cluster layout to handle both directories and components
     - Modified force simulation to apply proper forces to components
     - Created component boxes with cyan fill (#80DEEA) and tooltips for descriptions
   - Updated legend to include Component entry

2. **src/extension.ts**
   - Added `RadiumConfigLoader` import
   - Created `configLoader` instance in `activate()`
   - Load configuration at startup
   - Pass `configLoader` to all `MapPanel.createOrShow()` calls (3 locations)

3. **package.json**
   - Added dependencies: `js-yaml` and `@types/js-yaml`

4. **README.md**
   - Added "Component-Based Visualization (radium.yaml)" section under Configuration
   - Included YAML example and feature list
   - Updated Legend to include Component
   - Reference to radium.yaml.example

5. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added [Unreleased] section documenting the new feature
   - Listed all radium.yaml capabilities

## File Syntax

```yaml
project-spec:
  components:
    - componentKey:
        name: Display Name
        description: Optional description
        files:
          - path/to/files/**
          - specific/file.ts
```

## How It Works

1. At extension activation, `RadiumConfigLoader` checks for `radium.yaml` at workspace root
2. If found, parses the YAML and validates the structure
3. When building the map, `buildHierarchicalGraph()` checks if config exists
4. If config exists, uses `buildComponentBasedGraph()` instead of directory-based grouping
5. Each file is matched against component patterns using glob matching
6. Components appear as cyan boxes in the visualization, similar to directory boxes but with different styling
7. Files are nested within their matched component
8. Unmatched files fall back to directory-based grouping

## Visual Differences

### Without radium.yaml (Directory-based):
- Gray boxes for directories
- Files grouped by physical directory structure

### With radium.yaml (Component-based):
- Cyan boxes for components (with optional description tooltips)
- Files grouped by logical architecture
- Can span multiple directories

## Pattern Matching

Supports:
- Exact paths: `src/views/map-panel.ts`
- Wildcards: `src/views/*.ts`
- Recursive: `src/views/**`
- Complex globs: `src/**/test_*.py`

## Testing

✅ Compiles successfully with TypeScript
✅ No linter errors
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Backward compatible (works without radium.yaml)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- File watcher to reload config when radium.yaml changes
- Command to validate radium.yaml syntax
- UI to generate/edit radium.yaml
- Statistics showing component coverage
- Component-level metrics and analysis
