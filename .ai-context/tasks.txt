Symbol visualization view tasks:

$$ variable changes inside functions are still drawn as "variable" boxes. they should be categorized and function changes

$$ some changes inside functions are not categorized correctly and the FILE box is displayed instead of a function box

$$ a change to a file causes an highlighting of all boxes inside the file instead of only the relevant one

$$ when detecting a change, extract the comments and display them in large fonts above the changed file for 3 seconds

$$ symbol vis view tooltip should display in fonts convinient for reading regardless of zoom level

$$ in the symbol vis view, render a grid with think gray lines in the background

$$ the label in a symbol box (e.g. "myFunction() ~") should use larger font size as the box size increases  - make sure the label still fits in the box
